# Using agent-browser in an orb

agent-browser and Chrome for Testing (Chromium) are preinstalled in every orb. Run
`agent-browser skills get core --full` first; it is the version-matched reference for commands,
refs, sessions, restore, and recording. This skill adds only what the orb environment changes.

## Environment

- The browser runs inside the orb. It can open `http://localhost:<port>` dev servers directly. Only
  the user needs portal URLs, so share the portal URL with the user and never the localhost URL you
  browsed.
- If Chrome is missing, run `agent-browser install`.
- For a self-signed HTTPS dev server, pass `--ignore-https-errors` and
  `--args "--allow-running-insecure-content"` on the first `open`. Prefer an HTTP port when the
  server offers one.
- Pass the identical `--args` value on every command for that session, or wrap the invocation in a
  script. A changed or missing `--args` value relaunches Chrome without the flags, silently.
  `--args` splits on every comma, so a comma-valued Chrome flag cannot go through it; use an
  `--executable-path` wrapper instead (see Hover-gated UI).
- Save every screenshot and recording the user should see under `.amp/in/artifacts/` by absolute
  path. The thread renders media only from the workspace, so files under `/tmp` show as broken
  placeholders. A path starting with `.` is read as a CSS selector.

## Sessions

- Reuse one named `--session` for a whole workflow. Keep at most three live sessions in one
  namespace; reuse or close one instead of opening a fourth. Keep session names to 20 characters or
  fewer so the Unix socket path stays under its 103-byte limit.
- Close sessions as soon as their part of the workflow ends, and before memory-heavy work such as
  test suites or builds.
- The browser daemon dies on orb pause and resume, on CLI restarts, and after an idle hour. Pass
  bare `--restore` on every command for a session that must keep login state. Restore keeps
  cookies and storage only: after a relaunch, `open <full URL>` (not bare `reload`) and reapply
  `set viewport`, `set device`, and `set media`.
- `[agent-browser] restore: missing; save: saved` is startup metadata, not a failure.
- A shell helper that creates sessions installs an `EXIT` trap as soon as it knows the session
  names; a Node or TypeScript helper closes them in `finally`. Call cleanup explicitly on the
  success path too; a hard command timeout can skip the trap, so run cleanup in the next command
  after a timeout.

```bash
export AGENT_BROWSER_NAMESPACE=checkout-flow
SESSIONS=(buyer admin)
cleanup() {
	for session in "${SESSIONS[@]}"; do
		agent-browser --session "$session" --restore close >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
	done
}
trap cleanup EXIT

agent-browser --session buyer --restore open "$BUYER_URL"
agent-browser --session admin --restore open "$ADMIN_URL"
for session in "${SESSIONS[@]}"; do
	agent-browser --session "$session" --restore set viewport 1280 720 2
done

# workflow

cleanup
trap - EXIT
```

## Screenshots

- Screenshots must be 2x (`devicePixelRatio` 2); 1x looks blurry on retina displays. Run
  `set viewport <w> <h> 2` after the first `open` of a new or restarted session and after any
  `set viewport` that omits the scale, which resets that tab to 1x. Check with
  `eval devicePixelRatio` before capturing. Image pixel coordinates are then 2x the CSS values;
  selector clips are unaffected. Recordings stay at 1x.
- Set screenshot scale with `set viewport`, not Chromium's `--force-device-scale-factor` launch
  flag. Combining the launch flag with viewport DPR produces incorrectly sized full-page captures.
- `set viewport`, `set device`, and init scripts apply to the current tab only. A popup opened by
  page code (`window.open`, `target=_blank`) gets neither; `tab new <url>` and
  `click <selector> --new-tab` replay init scripts but not the viewport. Open new pages with
  `tab new <url>` instead of triggering a popup, and after `tab <id>` onto any new tab check
  `eval devicePixelRatio` and rerun `set viewport <w> <h> 2` if it is not 2.
- Wait for the element, text, URL, or app-specific ready signal before every capture. After a
  viewport change, wait for two animation frames:
  `eval "new Promise(r => requestAnimationFrame(() => requestAnimationFrame(r)))"`.
- Pass a selector or ref as the first `screenshot` argument only when the element sits inside the
  initial unscrolled viewport. Selector captures clip against the unscrolled surface, so below-the-
  fold or scrolled elements come out blank white and `scrollintoview` does not fix it. For those,
  scroll and capture the viewport without a selector, or capture `--full` and crop.
- Capture every representative affected state, not only the default one: open, selected, empty,
  loading, and error states when the change touches them.
- Inspect every capture with the media viewing tool before reporting it. For exact colors or
  measurements, sample pixels with Python and Pillow instead of judging by eye.
- Use `set viewport <w> <h> 2` at several widths for breakpoint checks. A 390-pixel Chromium
  capture proves the narrow layout only; it is not a phone capture (see Touch and mobile).

## Hover-gated UI

Headless Chromium reports no input device: `(hover: none)` matches and `(pointer: fine)` does not.
Hover-gated UI such as tooltips never appears on `hover` or `mouse move`, and touch fallbacks render
in screenshots. To test hover, relaunch through a wrapper that adds the Blink settings:

```bash
cat > /tmp/chrome-desktop-pointer.sh <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
chrome=$(ls -d "$HOME"/.agent-browser/browsers/chrome-*/chrome | sort -V | tail -n 1)
exec "$chrome" \
	'--blink-settings=primaryHoverType=2,availableHoverTypes=2,primaryPointerType=4,availablePointerTypes=4' \
	"$@"
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/chrome-desktop-pointer.sh
agent-browser --session app close
agent-browser --session app --executable-path /tmp/chrome-desktop-pointer.sh open "<url>"
```

Verify `eval "matchMedia('(hover: hover)').matches"` is `true` before trusting hover results. A
relaunch without the wrapper reverts.

## Touch and mobile

agent-browser is Chromium-only and never emulates touch. `set viewport` and `set device` change
size, DPR, and user agent only, so `(pointer: coarse)` stays unmatched and `(hover: none)` matches.
Touch-only styles change sizes, spacing, and layout, so never present a `set device` screenshot as
what the UI looks like on a phone.

For mobile screenshots, touch verification, and Safari-only rendering bugs, use Playwright device
profiles from a scratch directory outside the workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/wk && cd /tmp/wk && npm i playwright >/dev/null
npx playwright install webkit --with-deps      # iOS Safari approximation
```

```js
const { webkit, chromium, devices } = require('playwright')
const browser = await webkit.launch()
const context = await browser.newContext({ ...devices['iPhone 14'], ignoreHTTPSErrors: true })
const page = await context.newPage()
await page.goto(url)
if (!(await page.evaluate(() => matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches))) throw new Error('no touch')
await page.screenshot({ path: '/absolute/workspace/.amp/in/artifacts/mobile.png' })
```

- The full device descriptor (`hasTouch`) is what makes `(pointer: coarse)` match; use `.tap()`.
- Android: `chromium.launch()` with a Pixel descriptor covers Android Chrome touch behavior. Orbs
  have no KVM, so an emulator is not an option; never present this as a real device test.
- Linux WebKit approximates macOS Safari; system colors and native selection painting differ.
  Confirm macOS-specific bugs on real Safari.
- Say which engine produced a mobile capture and that `(pointer: coarse)` was verified.

## Fake microphone

Chromium's fake media stack turns a WAV file into the microphone signal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y espeak-ng
espeak-ng -s 145 -v en-us -w /tmp/raw.wav "Your dictation text here."
ffmpeg -y -i /tmp/raw.wav -af "adelay=700:all=1,apad=pad_dur=1" -ar 48000 -ac 1 /tmp/speech.wav
agent-browser --session mic \
  --args "--use-fake-device-for-media-stream,--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream,--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture=/tmp/speech.wav,--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required" \
  open "<url>"
```

The WAV must be mono 48 kHz `pcm_s16le`; it loops forever. Repeat the identical `--args` on every
command for that session. Verify with
`eval "navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({audio:true}).then(s=>s.getTracks()[0].label)"`, which
returns `Fake Default Audio Input`.

## Troubleshooting

- There is no `mouse click` subcommand. Use `click <selector-or-ref>`; for coordinates, use
  `mouse move <x> <y>`, `mouse down left`, `mouse up left`.
- Do not retry a hanging command in a loop. Run `agent-browser doctor --offline --quick`, inspect
  the session, then close and reopen it.
- If `open` reports `CDP command timed out: Page.navigate`, run `get url` once. If it shows the
  expected destination, continue.
- `batch` step strings strip quotes. For quoted JavaScript or selectors, pass a JSON array of
  argument arrays on stdin:
  `agent-browser batch <<'JSON'` … `[["open","https://example.com"],["eval","document.title"]]`.
- Wrap multi-statement `eval` in an IIFE or block. Top-level `const` and `let` persist across
  calls in a session and cause `Identifier has already been declared`.
- The orb's agent-browser build has no runtime `addinitscript` command. Pass `--init-script <path>`
  when launching the browser instead.
- If `open` lands on `about:blank` or `snapshot` shows `(no interactive elements)` for a local
  HTTPS server, relaunch with the HTTPS flags from Environment on the first `open`.
