# Subagent

Use the `subagent` CLI to delegate work to a separate Pi process with its own context and tmux session. Managed subagents cannot spawn nested subagents, and this skill is not loaded into their sessions.

## Spawn

Give each child a short, descriptive name. The name appears in the parent UI, while the generated handle remains its stable identifier:

```sh
subagent spawn --name implementation --prompt "Complete task"
```

By default, the child inherits the current Pi provider, model, and reasoning level from the bash environment. Use `--provider`, `--model`, or `--thinking` only when deliberately choosing a different configuration, for example a faster model for simple investigation or a stronger model for difficult review. Never pass `$PI_PROVIDER`, `$PI_MODEL`, or `$PI_REASONING_LEVEL` back to the CLI explicitly.

`--cwd` defaults to the current directory. Repeat `--prompt` and `--file` as needed; Pi receives all of them in the first user turn. Run `subagent spawn` directly without piping or redirecting its concise output.

## Tools

Without `--tools`, Pi enables its four default tools:

- `read` - Read text files and images.
- `bash` - Execute shell commands. This can also modify files, so it is not a read-only capability.
- `edit` - Apply exact text replacements to existing files.
- `write` - Create or overwrite files.

Three additional built-in tools are available but off by default:

- `grep` - Search file contents.
- `find` - Find files by glob pattern.
- `ls` - List directory contents.

`--tools` is a comma-separated allowlist across built-in, extension, and custom tools. Common choices:

```sh
# Enforced read-only repository investigation
--tools read,grep,find,ls

# Investigation that may run tests or other commands; bash can modify files
--tools read,bash,grep,find,ls

# Implementation work: omit --tools to use the defaults
```

## Isolation flags

- `--no-extensions` - Disable normal extension discovery. Use for an independent run that should not inherit unrelated extension behavior or extension-provided tools. The subagent control bridge is still explicitly loaded.
- `--no-skills` - Hide installed skills from the child. Use for tightly specified tasks that should rely only on the supplied prompt and files.
- `--no-prompt-templates` - Disable prompt-template commands. Usually unnecessary, but useful when testing a minimal child environment.
- `--no-context-files` - Ignore repository instruction files such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Use only when those instructions would bias an independent investigation. Do not use for implementation unless intentionally bypassing repository guidance.

Spawn prints a random handle and the exact tmux attach command. Keep the handle for later commands. Subagents persist after their current turn completes: `wait`, completion, and becoming idle do not terminate them. They survive `/reload`. When the spawning Pi session quits or is replaced, they are suspended and relaunched idle with their history when that session is resumed. They are only removed by `subagent stop`.

## Inspect and wait

```sh
subagent status <handle>
subagent list
subagent wait <handle>
```

Run `subagent list` at any time to rediscover active subagents and their handles, names, and current states if you no longer remember them.

`wait` follows the durable session state and prints the latest final assistant response. Run it directly so the bash tool returns that response; do not redirect it to a file or pipe it unless the user explicitly asks for an artifact. Do not infer completion from captured terminal text. Set the bash timeout above `wait`'s default 1800-second deadline.

## Communicate

```sh
# Change the name shown in the parent UI.
subagent rename <handle> "new name"

# Idle: starts a new prompt. Busy: steers the current work.
subagent send <handle> "message"

# Busy: waits until current work finishes, then starts another turn.
subagent send <handle> --follow-up "message"
```

Names are 1–64 characters and need not be unique. Messages use the subagent extension's control inbox; do not use `tmux send-keys`.

## Stop

```sh
subagent stop <handle>
```

Explicitly stop every subagent when it is no longer needed; do not leave completed subagents running idle. This terminates tmux and removes the run transcript and metadata. Keep an idle subagent alive only when concrete follow-up work is expected, then stop it afterward.

The interactive `/subagent` command lists active subagents spawned by the current Pi session. Selecting one suspends the current Pi TUI and attaches to its tmux session; detaching returns to the parent Pi. When the parent already runs inside tmux, selection switches the current tmux client instead.
